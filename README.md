I developed a Google Gemini clone using React that functions like ChatGPT. The project leverages the Gemini API from the @google/generative-ai package, which is a method designed for generating conversational answers. Users can interact with the application, receiving AI-generated responses similar to those from ChatGPT. This setup showcases the integration of advanced generative AI capabilities in a web application.
